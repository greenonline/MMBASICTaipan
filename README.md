# MMBASICTaipan
A port of the [book version](https://taipangame.com/pdf/TaipanAHistoricalAdventureForTheAppleComputerAppleIIEdition.pdf) of [Taipan!](https://taipangame.com) to MMBASIC, principally for the PicoMite "boot-to-BASIC" computer.

Complete and playable. However, some *minor* UI placement issues persist (and are *work in progress*).
